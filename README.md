# Html-CSS-JS Projects
This will contain all the front end html/CSS/JS projects that I've done.
MyMeen is my major frontend Project which focuses on a anti-dopamine social media platform. It's called MyMeen since you get to control your dopamine triggers instead of vice versa by focusing on a limited and simple UI that has a limited friend group and other types of accounts. It utilizes the main aspects of any frontend project those being HTML, CSS and JavaScript with the use of other potential frameworks and libraries such as bootstrap, React and React Native.
